## Types for `"extendable-lexical-editor"`

### What is `LexicalSchema.d.ts`?

- Generated by an LLM (ChatGPT 5) after reviewing `./src/nodes/PlaygroundNodes.ts` and its dependencies.
- A standalone serialized schema enumerating all nodes registered in `src/nodes/PlaygroundNodes.ts`, including custom nodes that are not part of any `@lexical/*` package.

### Why does this file exist?

- The intention of `LexicalSchema.d.ts` is to provide a clear standalone schema for producing valid Lexical JSON for this project.
- By adhering to the types defined in `LexicalSchema.d.ts` alone (without cross-referencing type information elsewhere), you can construct valid `editorState` JSON that loads correctly in `"extendable-lexical-editor"`.

### What is `LexicalSchemaSample.lexical`?

- `LexicalSchemaSample.lexical` is a concrete, valid JSON document that follows the types in `LexicalSchema.d.ts`.
- It can be loaded into the editor as a working example of how to structure serialized nodes (including custom nodes) according to the schema.

### Scope and updates

- The schema is intentionally scoped to the nodes registered in `PlaygroundNodes.ts`. If you add or remove nodes there, update `LexicalSchema.d.ts` accordingly so the contract remains accurate.
